Parameters:

HTTP request can use parameters/payloads to transmit data along side the request

Data/payloads can be sent alongside http requests in Body (not headers)

Body:

Really not a lot of rules for what goes inside the body, the browser or whatever tool is making the request will convert the body to base64 code to ensure it is URL friendly

Parameters are found in query string of URL (everythying after ?)

Response does not have querystring - it has a payload that stores all of the information you want returned
