802.1q = The protocol we use to create trunks on ethernet networks.

Its not uncommon for a organization to have lots of VLANS and lots of switches

If user Bob is connected to a port/interface that’s assigned to VLAN 10 - when he sends a frame that switch knows the frame is associated to VLAN 10 -- ***however, what if the switch needs to forward that frame to another switch?

- We need to configure a 802.1Q trunk to facilitate letting the downstream switch know what VLAN the original source is associated with.

When Bobs broadcast is sent into the network, when the access layer sends frame to core switch it:

1. TAGs frame to let it know the frame is associated with VLAN 10
2. To implement tagging, we configure the link between the core/access switch as a trunk.

Imagine I am frame sent from the VLAN 10 - if it’s a broadcast, access layer switch knows to flood it on all ports including trunk ports - meaning the frame will additionally be forwarded to core switch

802.1Q tagging is just adding additional information (specifically the VLAN ID) to a frame being send between 2 switches on configured trunk link

Show interfaces trunk

In summary, the purpose & use of trunking in an ethernet network are to let the downstream/receiving switch know what vlan/network the incoming frame is associated with.

Benefit - now we have 2 switches with a single trunk link that logically manage/forward tons of frames across multiple VLANS

Next, when a frame whats to get sent out of the network, layer 3 comes in
